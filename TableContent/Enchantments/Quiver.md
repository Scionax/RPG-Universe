## Quiver

Enchanted quivers are primarily advantageous due to their ability to conjure arrows. These quivers can hold any arrows the user adds, such as magical arrows that out-perform any conjured ones, but it effectively supplies infinite ammunition. Upgrades can improve the types of possible arrows that the quiver can conjure.

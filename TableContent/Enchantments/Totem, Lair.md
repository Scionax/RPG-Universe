## Totem, Lair

A lair is considered a base of operations. The “guardian” is the lair’s non-corporeal overseer that has full control over the lair’s enchantments, and operates entirely under the instructions of the owner. A totem is an enchanted altar that will merge its energies with the area’s leylines after a few days. The area of effect starts at 200x200 meters, but grows 50 meters along both axes for every upgrade acquired.

### Dimensional Lair

If a dimensional enchantment is added to the lair totem, the nature of the lair and the totem both change.

The lair itself expands its internal dimensions, growing up to three times larger in interior space without affecting the outside world. Additional rooms can be added, existing rooms can expand in size, hallways can extend in length, and so forth. The change takes several days to complete, with the internals of the lair stretching and morphing throughout this duration. These additions and changes can be chosen with the original design, but can’t be modified afterward without the appropriate upgrades.

The totem is now bound to the location by need. Once this enchantment has taken root, the totem cannot release its power without destroying the entire lair. The lair will be slowly crumpled, both physically and its pocket dimension, collapsing and reducing itself to rubble over the course of several days. All of the original physical structure of the lair will end in a state of demolition.

## Deck, Teleportation

A teleportation deck is a tier 5 treasure prior to any additional upgrades. It contains 15 to 30 blank “portal” cards that a user can attune to a given location. Once attuned, the card reveals a still image of the location. The user can then concentrate on the card to teleport there. The user will briefly observe the area in real time, giving them an opportunity to step through safely or choose not to.

Once attuned, the card is locked to its position permanently. It cannot be re-attuned to a new location. It takes a short scene to attune a portal card to its destination, and the location must not be warded.

## Rune, Slowing

A slowing rune, when activated, conjures a viscous sludge-like covering on the ground. The rune can be triggered by an intentional throw or placement, which causes the sludge to conjure and rapidly spread into the designated area. By default, it takes thirty seconds to complete its spread, and will cover a surface area up to 3 meters in diameter.

Any typical creature attempting to pass the area without sufficient resistances or advantages to overcome it will suffer a 20% penalty to their movement rate; much like walking through ankle-high water.

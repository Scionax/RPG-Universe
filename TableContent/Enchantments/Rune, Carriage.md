## Rune, Carriage

A carriage rune, when activated on land, will conjure a carriage or wagon. It is typically triggered by an intentional throw or placement, which begins to unfurl and conjure the carriage within seconds.

Carriage runes also use Vehicle Enchantment upgrades, including the Land-Based upgrades.

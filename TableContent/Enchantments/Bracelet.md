## Bracelet

Enchanted bracelets come in sets of two to four, allowing each to be worn by a different user. Each bracelet can be attuned to other enchanted bracelets (up to five total) to create an intuitive link between those users. As long as the attuned users are wearing their bracelets they can sense the direction and distance of any connected partner.

Each bracelet is upgraded separately, and only gains the benefits of its own upgrades.

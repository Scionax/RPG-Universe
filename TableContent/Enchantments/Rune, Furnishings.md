## Rune, Furnishings

A furnishing rune is a “room in a box” that is generally triggered by an intentional throw or placement.  When activated, it conjures all of the furnishings it contains into it’s environment. The furnishings will rapidly begin to appear from extra-dimensional pockets and leap into place like they’re being moved on puppet strings.

The effect takes a short scene (several minutes) to complete, depending on the complexity of the scene and the complexity of the resulting design. The furnishings cannot comprehend anything beyond their purpose of being set up correctly, but will not disrupt the positioning of someone or something present.

A furnishing rune can store as much volume as an average-sized room, making it far more spacious than an enchanted container, but it has several limitations. The rune cannot extract specific furnishings. Retrieving anything from the rune requires every furnishing item to appear, and the full setup process will occur. Furnishings cannot be moved outside of the rune’s range (roughly 10 meter radius) or they will collapse back into their pocket dimension and be unrecoverable for several weeks. Lost furnishings will eventually be recovered to the rune.

It generally takes a full scene of concentration to attune a typical piece of furniture to the rune, and the user must already be somewhat familiar with it. Decorations may only take a short scene. Recalling the furnishings back to the rune with the proper method takes a short scene as it reverses the opening effect.

## Grenade Clip

An enchanted grenade clip is an equipped item that can hold enchanted grenades; most clips hold three to five with a variety of different designs. After someone uses an enchanted grenade that they were attuned to, it’s essence can be regenerated into a grenade clip they’re attuned to. Each slot on the clip can regenerate the essence of one such enchanted grenade separately.

Enchanted grenades will naturally queue up for the next available slot in a grenade clip in the order they were used. Once a slot is available, they will regenerate over the course of their regeneration time.

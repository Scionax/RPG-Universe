## Remote

Primitive versions of the remote are a small pad with five to ten enchanted buttons. Modern variants may have additional electronic features, but otherwise serve the same function. Each enchanted button will trigger a magical effect nearby when pressed. They are programmed separately with a scene of concentration.

## Rune, Creature

An enchanted creature rune can contain a single creature within a pocket dimension, or retrieve the creature to return it into the world. The creature does not experience the passage of time while contained. They do not age, heal, or require sustenance. Being contained will not affect the creature’s mood or thoughts directly, but it may be confused or disoriented from a sudden change of scenery when released.

Creatures must be attuned the rune before they can be contained, which requires a long scene of effort. Only non-magical domesticated creatures can be attuned unless the dimensional space is upgraded to accommodate magic. The size limit for the contained creature is anything that can comfortably rest within a 50cm x 50cm x 50cm volume of space.

Once a creature is attuned to the rune, it can be contained or retrieved in a short scene (2-5 minutes). The rune must contain and release creatures within a range of 2 meters.

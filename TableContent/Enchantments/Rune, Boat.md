## Rune, Boat

A boat rune, when activated on water, will conjure a boat. It is typically triggered by an intentional throw or placement into the water, which begins to unfurl and conjure the boat within seconds.

Boat runes also use Vehicle Enchantment upgrades, including the Water-Based upgrades.

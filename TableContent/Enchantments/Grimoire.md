## Grimoire

A grimoire is a tome of magic and utility; often used by alchemists or mages, but far more versatile and useful to be limited to casters. When opened, a grimoire is opened to a desired “tab” based on the reader’s intent. Each “tab” is effectively considered a separate book with it’s own pages and content. When the grimoire is closed, it can be re-opened to any other tab.

Any tab upgrade can be acquired multiple times, such as to have four separate research topics and three spellbooks of different spell classifications. Each tab has exactly as many pages as the grimoire itself does, which is generally between 100 to 200.

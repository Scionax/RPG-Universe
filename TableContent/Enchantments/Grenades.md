## Grenades

Artifact grenades are small, disposable orb-shaped ceramic or glass canisters that will incur an enchanted explosion or burst effect with magical properties. Though the grenades are single-use, their essence can be recovered and regenerated from any distance if the owner possesses a Grenade Clip.

### Grenade Archetypes

Every grenade has a special archetype: frag, knockback, disorient, fire, frost, acid, shock, stun, or sleep. Each has its own traits and behaviors that apply to its use.

 **Archetype** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Regen Time** 
---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------:
 Acid          | Deals elemental acid damage. Extremely painful, disorienting, and creates very serious lasting scars. It is physically damaging to skin and hide, but generally doesn’t present a lethal threat by itself. High exposure to internals, however, can quickly become very life-threatening.         | 1 week         
 Disorient     | Creates powerful burst of light and sound (flashbang effect). Effective at disorienting humans and natural wildlife; may affect monsters much differently. Non-lethal attack, no permanent damage. Disorientation is strong, and fades over a few rounds. Disrupts vision and hearing.            | 3 days         
 Fire          | Deals a burst of elemental fire and heat damage and can incite fires. Increases body temperature of directly affected targets, which may incur status penalties. Can leave serious burns.                                                                                                         | 1 week         
 Frag          | Generates an explosion of physical fragments (grenade effect). Causes physical piercing damage and a knockback effect. Very effective against most forms of life.                                                                                                                                 | 1 week         
 Frost         | Deals a burst of elemental ice, frost, and cold damage. Leaves snow and mist lingering; can put out fires. Cools body temperature of directly affected targets, which may incur status penalties (particularly slow effects). Minimal damage, generally non-lethal to most forms of life.         | 3 days         
 Knockback     | Generates a powerful knockback effect similar to frag explosions, but with additional emphasis on knockback and less emphasis on damage. The effect is generally non-lethal, but it has concussive force that can create minor disorientation.                                                    | 3 days         
 Shock         | Generates a strong electrical burst. Disrupts the magnetic field and is particularly disruptive against technology. Has roughly half of the impact of “stun” on any targets in range.                                                                                                             | 3 days         
 Sleep         | Generates a gas explosion with sleeping agents and enchantments. Victims affected will have a status effect that challenges their mental fortitude and stamina to remain awake. Must be breathed in. Users affected will likely have significant fatigue statuses if they don’t fall unconscious. | 1 week         
 Stun          | Creates a non-lethal electrical burst that stuns for a very short time (a few seconds at most). The effect tends to be extremely effective against most humanoids and creatures, despite being temporary. Monsters may have different reactions.                                                  | 1 day

 Regen            | Grenade’s regeneration time is reduced by 50%.                                              | 3        
 Auto-Trigger     | Grenade can optionally detonate near desired mid-air position, or after a certain distance. | 3        
 Major Intensity  | Increases damage or intensity of effect by an additional 30%.                               | 4        
 Major Radius     | Increases radius of effect by an additional 30%.                                            | 4        
 Directional      | Can optionally direct the explosion into a cone-shape in the direction thrown.              | 4

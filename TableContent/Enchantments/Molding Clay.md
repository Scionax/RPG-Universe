## Molding Clay

Molding clay is a fist-sized clump of enchanted clay. It can be shaped and molded into simple items through focused intent and willpower. The resulting items may not be pretty, but they should fulfill basic requirements. Users with exceptional crafting skills may experience better results.

By default, molding clay will produce average quality items and result in a clay or ceramic product. It takes roughly one minute of focused concentration to will the item into creation. It will create items that can be designed as a single, solid piece, such as a chisel or a jar. If parts of the clay are damaged or lost, it will reform back into its original full clump over the course of a day.

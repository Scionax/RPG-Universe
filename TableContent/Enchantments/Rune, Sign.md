## Rune, Sign

A sign rune, when activated, transforms into an enchanted sign (or poster, etc) designed by the owner. The sign generates an enchanted area of effect of 200x200 meters that grows 50 meters along both axes for every upgrade acquired. The enchanted sign can be deactivated and transformed back into a rune with a short scene of effort.

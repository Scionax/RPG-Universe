## Umbrel

Umbrel are two-sided coins with a bizarre half-spin that makes them flip three times before returning to their original state. Two “sides” face the real world (known collectively as the “terrestrial side”), and one “side” faces the astral realm. The astral side of the coin always appears as a wispy white and yellow color with a hardened, smooth texture.

### Fey Umbrel

Fey Umbrel’s terrestrial side is made of smoothed petrified wood, with beautiful etchings of powerful symbols that glow gently with an amber hue.

Purchases with Fey Umbrel are made by intent, and the coin will dissipate once spent. Within a short scene, a spirit from the astral realm will accept the payment and cross into the terrestrial realm with the host body of a creature they are capable of inhabiting. The user can request a particular type of creature, within certain limitations, to narrow the types of spirit that will accept the payment. This may increase the duration that the payment takes, potentially up to a long scene.

Once a spirit has crossed over with a host creature, it loses its previous memories and the payment it received. It will only recover those memories after its departure from the terrestrial realm. It is instead filled with the feeling of a strong bond, loyalty, and connection to the user that performed the payment.

The creature then becomes a familiar of the user, capable of significantly higher intelligence than their nature equivalent. More powerful spirits may possess magical traits when they transition into the terrestrial realm such as the telepathic communication, enhanced perceptions, physical augmentations, magical resistances, etc.

### Passage Umbrel

Passage Umbrel’s terrestrial side is made of light-green jade with etchings of symbols that glow white. It can be spent to purchase passage through the astral realm, allowing nearly instantaneous teleportation across the terrestrial realm.

When the coin is held, the user can intend a location that they wish to travel to. The location will be identified correctly, even if the user has never seen the destination before, as long as the intention is clear enough to be identified and is allowed by the purchase. Some coins are limited by distance or restricted to locations the user has visited before. Others can grant loosely defined destinations, such as “the nearest ship owned by one of my allies” or “to the house of the oldest man alive.”

Once a valid intention is made, the coin will blink out of the terrestrial realm and the user will receive a clairvoyant viewing of the location. The user will observe the location in real time as though they are standing there, and can feel an invisible “passage” gently pulling them. The user step can through the passage at any time, and will instantly emerge on the other side where they stepped through. If the user does not step into the location within a short scene, the passage will close.

 Passage II  | Travel anywhere. User must have a known, specific, identifiable destination in mind. | 4        
 Passage III | Travel anywhere. User can provide loosely defined destinations.                      | 5        

### Vault Umbrel

Vault Umbrel’s terrestrial side is made of smooth black marble, with an ornate symbol that glows in a soft white. It can be spent on purchasing a vault in the astral realm, which will allow one insertion and one removal of contents.

When the power is initially purchased, an astral pocket appears. The mouth of the astral pocket is a small rift between dimensions that allows contents to be added or removed, and which can only be accessed by the user. Once contents have been added into the vault, the white glow on the coin’s symbol change to a deep blue glow to indicates contents are stored.

When the user activates a coin with a glowing deep blue symbol, they can retrieve the contents they originally added. This fulfills the payment with the coin, causing it to dissipate.

The vault is generally considered to contain “one” item, although that item could be an entire chest filled with belongings. However, retrieval of the vault constitutes all of its contents being removed, so individual items cannot be removed since a single removal would constitute a fulfilled payment.

 Vault I  | Vault can contain a small item: dagger, book, tool, glasses, etc. | 1

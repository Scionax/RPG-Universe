## Shards

Shards are fractured coins, generally split into three to eight parts, whose fractured pieces remain supernaturally locked in position with each other to maintain a single coin. The more fragments the coin is split into the more powerful it is. Each type of shard is different in color to distinguish them, but they share a consistent theme.

### Divining Shards

Divining Shards call upon the powers of divination gods and spirits to grant insight into missing information that has been concealed, lost, or undiscovered. When a Divining Shard is held, it can be activated by providing an intention of a particular subject to divine. Upon being activated, a god or spirit from another realm will prepare insight into the topic in expectation of divining requests.

Each fragment of the coin indicates the number of “missing pieces” or significant areas of knowledge that will be retrieved about the topic that isn’t already known by the user. The power is therefore more effective if the user already knows a lot about the subject before using the coin.

A “missing piece” of knowledge generally provides enough content to write a full essay on, meaning the insights gained can be very valuable. However, the user can only request information in the form of “yes or no” questions, limiting its effectiveness. Each time a question is asked, one of the fragments disappears, and the user will receive an answer. This process continues until all of the fragments have been used.

Users will not be mislead to incorrect conclusions. If the answer itself is misleading due to rare or trivial exceptions that would otherwise change the answer, the user will intuitively sense that such special caveats exist that informed that answer. If the desired information could not be divined, the question will not be answered and no fragment will be lost.

If desired, the user can will the Shard to research a brand new subject, overwriting the last research. However, this will cost one of the remaining fragments, since the divining spirits had already performed the research.

 Divining III | Coin possesses eight fragments. Eight pieces, eight questions. | 4        

### Reality Shards

Reality Shards are mirror-like fragmented Shards, with each fragment reflecting a different image than the one peering into it. It possess the ability to call upon the powers of a divining primordial to choose a path of reality based on interpretations and decisions.

It may be widely believed that Reality Shards split, dilate, and realign reality. However, the truth involves the exploitation of divination magic. The user experiences multiple simulations of the future by living through them, but it is purely a mental experience. Once the simulations are finished, the user instinctively chooses the most favorable outcome and reality is calibrated to return the user to that state.

During each simulation, the user retains their previous experience, allowing them to discover potential exploits over the course of multiple simulations. This often means the last simulation can be the most useful, although it doesn’t guarantee it.

 Reality Shard I   | User experiences two simulations, each lasting up to a minute.           | 4        
 Reality Shard II  | User experiences up to four simulations, each lasting for a short scene. | 5        
 Reality Shard III | User experiences up to eight simulations, each lasting for a full scene. | 6        

### Shatter Shards

Unlike most magical currencies, Shatter Shards are forged by the gods and primordials that deal in destruction, making them much more rare. They possess the power to shatter items, buildings, and other tangible things by willing it.

When a user holds the coin in their hand, they can intend for a designated physical object or structure within the coin’s limits to be destroyed. The object will shatter, crumbling into unusable pieces; or at least as much as the power can manage.

This power cannot work on objects that are forged with magic, is resisted by magical warding, and is resisted by auras. When an object is held or worn by someone that possesses an aura, its power is diminished based on the strength of the user’s aura. A typical human with just a trivial aura will still resist half of the power’s effect, while those with powerful auras tend to resist all of it.

Enchantments on buildings and other structures limit the power in the same way that an aura does. Each enchantment acts as a partial magical ward that help resist the effect.

 Shatter IV  | Shatter a mansion, the contents of a royal treasury, etc.                      | 4        
 Shatter V   | Shatter a palace, a city wall, a large temple, etc.                            | 5        

### Syncing Shards

Syncing Shards have soft translucent tendrils of energy that connect the different fragments of the Shard together, like they’ve been loosely bound together by threads. The energy tendrils are not tangible, however.

The power of a Syncing Shard is to create a shared mental web between multiple participants; a maximum number of which are equal to the fragments available on the shard. Anyone connected to the mental web can voluntarily exchange their thoughts across the web, and receive thoughts from others. More powerful variants can allow the participants to share perceptions or fast-paced instincts, which can assist with battle coordination.

A user can activate the power by holding the shard and willing the effect while present with the intended participants. Any participant can reject the connection if they choose to. The power generally lasts for a long scene or longer, although some variants that focus on instinctive advantages for battle coordination may only last for a short scene.

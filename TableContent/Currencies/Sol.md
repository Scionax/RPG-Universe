## Sol

Sol is a polished golden coin that feels warm to the touch and hums when being activated. There is always an etched symbol based on the Sol’s archetype: a shield emblem for Warrior Sol, and a ghost-like emblem for Guiding Sol.

When Sol services are called upon, chosen representatives will be sent to assist with the task. These representatives may be vessels living on the land, genies or spirits, or summoned phantoms. In any case, the power will retain the same effect.

Sol is easy and intuitive to spend, and only requires that the user makes the intent. The user can’t control precisely what they will receive, but it will relevant to their specific needs. Those responsible for fulfilling the request will honor the fairness of the payment and deliver suitable accommodations.

### Warrior Sol

Warrior Sol calls upon the warrior deities to provide powerful allies to assist in war, assassination, combat, or similar conflicts. If the warring representatives have sufficient time to assemble before summoning, the Sol’s payment will achieve it’s maximum effect. If the user requests an emergency activation, warrior representatives will be summoned immediately; however, their power will be halved.

The assistance provided may come in many forms. For war, a payment may result in legendary soldiers or small armies. For assassinations, a payment may provide well-equipped spies. For spontaneous combat, monsters or powerful beast allies may be temporarily summoned. Their presence is ephemeral and death is of no concern to them.

The duration of the effect will last throughout the primary challenge that was desired, but typically no longer than a normal scene (20 – 40 minutes).

### Guiding Sol

Guiding Sol requests assistance from the elder deities that value knowledge and experience to assist with any objective that requires intellectual finesse. This may include studying, investigation, forensics, scouting, and so forth.

Representatives sent to assist may vary depending on the type of help requested. They may come in the form of talking animals or trees, a team of researchers, an ancient spirit that possesses eons of knowledge, etc.

The duration of the guidance has very little to do with the value of the Sol itself. Some assistance may be as brief as a few minutes, or as long as several weeks. What matters is that the user receives an appropriate level of guidance or assistance equal to the value of the Sol.

## Whisper

Whisper is a highly transparent ghostly coin with the weight of a large feather. It is difficult to notice or feel, and can bend slightly when pressed. Its most defining characteristic are the wisps of gentle white tendrils that flow through the coin.

When the user holds the coin, they will instinctively know they can call upon a ghostly messenger. Upon doing so, a ghostly figure will appear and accept the coin as payment. It will then agree to deliver a message on your behalf. Upon describing the intended recipient and message to delivery, the ghostly messenger will immediately deliver the message on your behalf.

The ghostly messenger can traverse the astral instantly to arrive at the intended recipientâ€™s destination, and it will be able to identify the intended recipient as long as the user knows who they meant to deliver it to. The message will be delivered the moment the recipient is capable and ready to receive the message, and done so in a way that only the recipient will receive it.

More powerful variants of Whisper will attract spirits that can provide a full mental simulation of the experience the user wants to provide. This can include perceptions, imaginations, or whatever other experiences the user can imagine providing.

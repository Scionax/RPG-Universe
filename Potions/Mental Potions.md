## Mental Potions

Mental potions are created by meticulously copying the neural essence of an individual that possesses an extraordinary trait, and then refining the essence to isolate the desired trait. The process is very complex and time consuming, so most are reproductions of previous versions.

Too many mental potions in a short period can cause complications: foreign thoughts and feelings, hallucinations, or even confusion and temporary loss of functioning. One or two mental potions per month is considered safe.

### Flashback Potions

Flashback potions grant someone else’s memories of an experience. When combined with astral memories, the user can be immersed in a full deep-dive simulation. To outside observers the user will appear to be in a drugged, semi-responsive hallucinatory state.

### Memory Potions

Memory Potions permanently alter the user’s memory. These are extremely difficult to produce and enchant correctly due to the amount of information it has to parse before taking effect in an expected manner.

### Skill & Lore Potions

Skill and lore potions grant skills or knowledge, or improve upon existing capabilities.

Intrusive variants will implant themselves quickly, but at the cost of overwriting an existing set of neural pathways. If prepared for this effect, the user can focus on skills or knowledge they are willing to unlearn while the potion takes effect. Otherwise, the potion will overwrite the first neural patterns that seem underutilized.

Improved variants are expertly refined to integrate seamlessly with the user’s mind. However, due to the amount of precision required to integrate correctly, it can takes weeks before the information is fully integrated. The user may notice some trivial changes after a week or two, but this effect ramps up significantly toward the end of the process.

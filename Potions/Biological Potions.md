## Biological Potions

Biological potions involve the modification of a user’s genetics, anatomy, or other physical traits. Animals can also benefit from these potions, but larger or enchanted creatures may require a higher dosage.

Permanent variants require a long scene for the body to readjust to the change. During that time, the user will probably lose much of their normal functioning with the related effect due to the volatile changes taking effect. Temporary variants only require a few seconds to take effect, and have no uncomfortable experiences or loss of functioning.

### Ability Potions

Ability potions involve augmenting multiple sets of muscle memories, in addition to the neural webs to control them. Permanent variants involve a long scene of painful and disruptive transitions while the body and mind adjust to a flood of new information. Temporary variants last for a long scene, or just a scene with a half-dose.

### Genetic Potions

Dosage affects how significant a genetic change is. A partial dosage, for example, will only transition the user part way between the two states. Most transitional phases are physically uncomfortable, or downright painful, and are likely to disrupt the user’s normal actions.

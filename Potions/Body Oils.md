## Body Oils

Enchanted body oils can be considered living, viscous liquids that have some degree of autonomous behavior. The oil can move on its own and will rapidly spread itself out across skin on contact, making it extremely fast to apply. A full dosage will easily cover a normal sized body.

There are no permanent variants. All enchanted body oils will fade from their effect after a long scene of use.

## Rune, Warding

A warding rune, when activated, creates a spherical force field that resists incoming and outgoing magical energies (such as spells and magical powers). The rune can be triggered by an intentional throw or placement, which prepares the force field over the course of a short scene. By default, the force field can be up to 5 meters in diameter and resists 20% of all spells, powers, or magical effects that crosses its outside barrier.

All resistance types can be toggled on or off by the attuned user, but only before the force field is activated. Once the force field is activated, all resistances that were toggled on will remain active until the entire ward is disabled.

## Arrows

Arrow enchantments apply only to the specific arrow, not to a batch of them. If an enchanted arrow is destroyed or lost, its essence will eventually be recollected and returned to the attuned owner; generally to a quiver. Enchanted bolts, such as those used by crossbows, can also be considered enchanted arrows and use the same enchantments.

Once an arrow has been fired, it will take a short scene before it’s enchantments will fully recharge and function again.

----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:
 Cosmetics      | Arrow can be designed to user’s intent; can also include glyphs, glow, trailing effects, etc.       | 1

 Ricochet       | Arrow can ricochet off of a solid surface and maintain 98% of its momentum.                         | 1        
 Distance       | Arrow can travel up to 50% farther with equal effort.                                               | 2

 Accuracy       | Arrow’s precision is doubled; distance from intended target is halved.                              | 3        
 Targeting      | Adjusts its trajectory up to 5 cm in the last meter of flight to target less armor or a weak point. | 3        
 Elusive Strike | Arrow appears to be further behind than it really is, making it twice as hard to block.             | 3

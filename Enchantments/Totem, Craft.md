## Totem, Craft

A totem is an enchanted altar that will merge its energies with the area’s leylines after a few days. The area of effect starts at 200x200 meters, but grows 50 meters along both axes for every upgrade acquired. Craft totems act like a magical construction crew, and will help build the area as instructed to.

Craft totems make use of phantoms: semi-transparent ghostly figures with the physical capabilities of a young adult. Phantoms possess a very narrow form of intelligence that allows them to do exactly what is required for their job, and nothing else. Attempting to interact with a phantom is futile; it will not comprehend any sort of interaction it was not designed for. Phantoms can be destroyed, but they do not understand or feel pain, and will regenerate back to normal within hours. They do not get tired, do not require any sustenance, and do not stop working.

By default, a craft totem comes with a single phantom capable of simple manual labor, such as moving objects. It will make use of any carts, vehicles, containers, or tools designated for their tasks. Phantoms acquire a level of skill that is on par with an average professional with three years worth of experience.

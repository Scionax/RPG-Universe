## Servant Figurine

A servant figurine is a small, toy-like figurine made of stone about the size of a thumb. It looks like a typical human, likely dressed up and well-groomed. When activated, generally with a simple intention, it will grow into a normal-sized living human-like statue that will serve at it’s owner’s pleasure. The servant is hollow stone, but will only be as heavy as an average human would be. It typically returns to its figurine size if damaged or when it has no additional tasks to perform, and will also obey instructions to return to figurine size.

The servant is completely loyal and carefree, but has very limited intelligence. It has no voice, a limited understanding of the world, and can only carry out basic tasks and labor. The servant will attempt to aid its owner and will follow orders that it believes it can actually accomplish based on its current abilities.

When in figurine form, it will repair any injury and will do so twenty times faster than a human. If it remains in humanoid form, it will heal injuries like a regular human.

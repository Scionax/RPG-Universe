There are two types of enchanted tattoos: bio tattoos and storage tattoos.

### Storage Tattoos

Enchanted storage tattoos have a tattoo form and a conjured form that reflect each other. The tattoo is “storing” an item’s archetype essence in an extra dimensional pocket, and can release the item from its essence container when the user retrieves it. Retrieval is done partially by reaching for tattoo, and partially by willing the tattoo out of the body. The tattoo will look similar to the item it is storing.

The item that is being converted into a tattoo must not be magical or enchanted in any way, unless the appropriate upgrade is applied to make it compatible. By default, only items the size of a fist or smaller can be stored in a storage tattoo. The tattoo can be easily moved by extracting the item and then putting it back onto the body, but it will not move on its own.

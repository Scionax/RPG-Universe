## Jewelry

Enchanted jewelry assists with impressions, commanding intention, and the implication of status or wealth. It can take the form of a ring, pendant, crown, or other accessory that is generally visible.

These powers can be toggled on or off at will by the user. They can also be resisted by resistances to mental magic, but are generally effective on most individuals.

## Envelope

Enchanted envelops will be magically delivered to their intended target by disappearing into the void and reappearing where the individual will recover it. The speed of delivery is equal to that of a messenger bird flying from the sender directly to the individual it was being delivered. It cannot be intercepted during travel and it will always find itâ€™s target if that target is alive and capable of receiving the message.

Once the contents are retrieved, an envelop will wait for a designated amount of time (assigned by the owner) for the individual to provide a response. When the individual provides a response, or when the time allowance has elapsed, it will return to its original owner.

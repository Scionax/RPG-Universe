## Auro Ring

Auro Rings (or “aurostone rings”) are enchanted rings that interact with significant energy fields and signals, including magical ones. They have many nuanced uses, such as identifying the user’s aura and acting as an interface between magical and digital environments.

The more enchantments added to an auro ring, the more capabilities and functions it can utilize. Auro rings often contain “energy programs” that use the ring’s abilities to perform interesting functions. For example, a ring could have a program that makes the ring vibrate and change color when it detects a significant increase in magnetic fields, or which automatically unlocks magilocks that the ring has a passcode for.

“Auro” is an alchemy gemstone. In it’s passive state, it takes on a semi-translucent light-silver color. It can radiate a small amount of light and changes color and brightness based on it’s active state. An aurostone is socketed into the ring, giving the ring it’s name.

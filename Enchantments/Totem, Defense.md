## Totem, Defense

A totem is an enchanted altar that will merge its energies with the area’s leylines after a few days. The area of effect starts at 200x200 meters, but grows 50 meters along both axes for every upgrade acquired. Multiple defense totems will not stack their effects.

Defense totems augment the defenses of the affected area, either by blessing allies or cursing enemies. Allies will be assigned intuitively following the owner’s judgment, and enemies are determined as those in direct opposition to the allies.

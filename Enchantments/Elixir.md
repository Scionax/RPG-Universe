## Elixir

An elixir is an enchanted vial that stores approximately 10 milliliters (2/3 of a tablespoon) per potion serving. The contained potion will refill over a given duration based on the potion’s enchantment complexity and essence requirements.

Elixirs are typically high tier artifacts due to the magic required to regenerate their contents. Each elixir naturally has one serving unless it was upgraded to contain more.

### Elixir Upgrades

These elixir upgrades can be acquired for any elixir.

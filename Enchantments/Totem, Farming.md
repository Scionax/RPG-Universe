## Totem, Farming

A totem is an enchanted altar that will merge its energies with the area’s leylines after a few days. The area of effect starts at 200x200 meters, but grows 50 meters along both axes for every upgrade acquired. Farming totems are used for gardening and crop production within its area of effect.

## Deck, Scrying

A scrying deck is a tier 4 treasure prior to any additional upgrades. It contains 25 to 50 blank “scrying” cards that a user can attune to a given location. Once attuned, the card reveals a still image of the location. The user can then concentrate on the card, activating its clairvoyance magic, to revisit the location in their mind. The user will observe the area in real time as though they are standing at the spot where they attuned the card.

Once attuned, the card is locked to its position permanently. It cannot be re-attuned to a new location. It takes a short scene to attune a scrying card to its destination, and the location must not be warded.

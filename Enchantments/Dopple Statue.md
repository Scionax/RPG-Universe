## Dopple Statue

A dopple statue is a life-sized sculpted bust that mimics the appearance of its owner. The statue is permanently attuned to the owner. It is capable of mimicking the owner’s voice and movements, within the limitations of being just a bust. It will mimic the owner’s facial motions and voice if the owner is concentrating on the attunement and is within a kilometer from its location.

## Rune, Trap

A trap rune conjures a trap at the location the rune is triggered, generally by an intentional throw or placement. The trap will automatically set itself over the course of a short scene (by telekinetic assist), return to rune form over the course of a short scene, and will obey owner instructions from up to 5 meters away. Once a trap rune has been returned to its rune form it has a long scene cooldown (3 to 6 hours) before it can be activated again.

The maximum surface area for triggering the trap is 0.5x0.5 meters, which increases by 0.1 meters on both axes per upgrade. The trap itself can be larger, and may require GM discretion. Consider a limit of 1 kilogram of material weight allowance that increases by 0.5 kilograms per upgrade.

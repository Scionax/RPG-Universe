## Cape

Outfit enchantments are also allowed on enchanted capes. Every tier worth of upgrade (including outfit enchantments) increases its wind speed effect by 1km/h.

At will, the user can treat their movement as though being affected by wind (equal to the capeâ€™s wind speed) from a cardinal direction of their choice (vertical is not allowed). This is cumulative with natural wind, meaning it will resist opposing winds or stack with supporting winds.

## Void Sheath

A void sheath is a tier-4 enchanted band that “contains” a small concealed weapon (or other small item) in an extra-dimensional pocket (like a bag of holding). The attuned weapon can be summoned at will to the user’s hand from up to 25 centimeters away.

The sheath is generally worn as a wristband, but it can be worn on any limb for an alternative compartment location. The default size allowance is roughly the size of a switchblade or a tiny lock-pick set. It takes an hour-long meditation to attune an item to the sheath, and a minute of concentration to return an attuned item back to the sheath’s compartment.

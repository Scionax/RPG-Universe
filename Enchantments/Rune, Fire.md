## Rune, Fire

A fire rune, when activated, will conjure a self-containing utility fire that is not harmful to anyone. It is typically triggered by an intentional throw or placement. It has a 1 meter maximum diameter, centered at the rune’s activation spot. It does not require fuel, but is affected by it. It can match the intensity of a campfire with fuel, and the intensity of a torch without fuel.

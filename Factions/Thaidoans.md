# Thaidoans

Ninety years before the great war, a human woman of extraordinary power lead eight Faunus disciples into the mountains of northern Vacuo. She identified herself only as Jade, and offered very little explanation to her arrival or backstory. There, in the corner of the world, she taught the underprivilged Faunus how to fight the forces of darkness.

Word around Vacuo began to spread about the supposed powers of the Sun Priestess on the mountain. She could defeat the most terrifying Grimm. She could peform legendary feats of power beyond what should have been possible, including the gift of flight. As the rumors grew, so did her following. What started as a camp for her disciples became a village, which grew into a stronghold. Several surrounding tribes emerged that began to accept her as a guardian of mankind.

Two of Jade's closest disciples began to take exhaustive notes about her life and her teachings, documenting entire stories about her life and organizing her teachings into doctrine. Due to the growing popularity of the teachings, Jade eventually decided to create an official practice. And thus, Thaido was born.

The Thaidoans are practitioners of Thaido: a combat style and way of life that was created by the Sun Priestess. Most Thaidoans of the modern age still live in the city of Pike; the original stronghold Jade founded. The school is known as the Temple of the Sun Priestess or the Jade Temple. It continues Jade's teachings and accepts a particularly high number of Faunus as students.

## Thaido

Thaido teaches a way of life that encourages peace and unity, except in the application of justice. It's users are taught to find peace within themselves and to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.

The base combat style that all Thaidoans learn is a martial art that emphasizes precision strikes with bladed weapons. However, this style was considered a stepping stone. Jade believed everyone had a "true" form that was meant only for them, but that they must discover it themselves. All practitioners of Thaido were told to evolve their fighting style to whatever became most successful for them. Service to justice was regarded as more important than style.

### Tenants of Thaido

The first tenant of Thaido reads "If one takes the eye of an innocent, take both of the eyes of the guilty. Tolerance of evil serves only the oppressor." It is meant to reinforce the idea that oppression is not solved by the voluntary actions of the guilty parties. Jade believed that serving justice meant inflicting genuine punishments against the evils of the world.

The second tenant, which is meant to reign in the first, reads "Fight not for your own cause, but for those who suffer more, lest you become the villain." It speaks to the concern of those who seek a selfish vengence rather than a righteous justice. According to the disciple's stories, Jade originally came to the mountains in fear that she would become vengeful if she did not isolate herself.

The third tenant reads "Doubt is not your enemy. To be closer to the truth is to discover you were wrong."

### Worship of the Sun Priestess

Because Jade's origin and power offered no good explanation to the people, she is typically regarded as a minor deity or goddess that came to Remnant to spread enlightenment. Due to the excellent record-keeping of her disciples, the distribution of her teachings, the generational knowledge that was passed down, and a number of well-established tribes that followed her teachings, many people in the area accept this.

Many of her teachings still have a strong presence in northern Vacuo, although there were major conflicts with tribes that claimed she was a false prophet and labeled her followers heretical. Their actions suppressed much of Jade's teachings, and threatened the Thaidoan's numbers for a time; particularly during the great war. There are ruins of many villages in the area surrounding Pike that were pillaged and destroyed from warring factions.

Original statues and portraits that were made of Jade still exist. Most of them are secured in Pike, which survived the tribal wars against the Thaidoans. The Temple of the Sun Priestess has the largest, most detailed sculpture of Jade in the world. It was created by one of her original disciples and is currently positioned in the center of the great hall for all to witness.

## A Brief History

During Jade's reign at Pike, no significant force was ever mustered to challenge her. She was able to easily quell any minor forces that raised against her followers. Though there were a large number of humans that opposed her philosophies and her kindness toward the Faunus, they were afraid of the magnificent powers that the Sun Priestess could wield.

After thirty two years of teaching at Pike and amassing a large following, Jade declared a final tenant: "Once you possess the strength to make change, tarry not. Stagnation enables the arousal of evil."

The next day, she was gone, leaving only a set of instructions for her closest disciples. The story of her disappearance was as mysterious and uncertain as her arrival. Despite many attempts to track her down, she was never heard from again. As intended, her disciples followed her instructions and took her place as the new leaders of the Thaidoan movement. Many followers abandoned the cause after Jade disappeared, or left Pike to take proactive steps as her final tenant had declared. Hundreds of devoted followers remained to carry on her teachings.

### The Attacks on Pike

After Jade's disappearance, many rallied against the Thaidoans. Despite the superior numbers that attacked Pike and its neighboring tribes, Pike had the overwhelming advantage of high ground and well-established mountain fortifications. Several tribes had to move to Pike as their villages were destroyed, but Pike remained unscathed. Thousands lost their lives trying to break Pike's defenses, and the attacks were considered a collosal failure.

### Combat Training

The combat school that Pike offers is certainly a prestigeous choice, and is open to anyone that is willing to follow the Thaidoan path. Just like with other combat schools, graduates of the Jade Temple often go on to apply to Vacuo and other major Huntsmen academies.

## Culture

Jade embraced all cultures and expected unity and kindness between all peoples. However, common trends in the disciples of Thaido began to develop over time.

In the modern age, the core Thaidoan disciples have a monk-like lifestyle. They live on very few needs, are respectful of others, and preach oneness and self-enlightenment. They train in Thaidoan combat, as well as seek to refine their own strengths. Disciples are expected to serve at least ten years outside of Pike as guardians of the world, often as warriors against the Grimm, once they possess the skills necessary to do so. Those who return are typically expected to teach the next generation of Thaidoans.

Prayer is not emphasized, as it was not part of the original tenants; however, some Thaidoans have found comfort in praying to the Sun Priestess. Pike has an annual day of reverence for the Sun Priestess that occurs on the Summer Solstice. During this day, there is to be no combat training of any kind.

### Anima Tattoos

Most Thaidoan disciple these days have adopted a custom of having 'anima' tattoos that reflect their personal psyche or style, once they feel they have discovered their true nature. These animas are usually reflected as one's "spirit animal," although it does not have to be a animal. It is common for animas to be elemental (fire, water, etc), celestial (moon, sun, stars, etc), vegetative (various species of plants and trees), or other types such as auras or symbols.

Each disciple must decide what anima most reflects them, and it is not for anyone else to define or judge their inner truth.

It is also common for disciples to get a tattoo of the Sun Priestess, or one of the symbols that is now attributed to her, as a way of keeping her blessings upon them.

### Social Status

There are no official ranks within Thaidoan culture, as Jade had intended everyone to see each other as equal, but there are positions of influence and general social heirarchies based on one's achievements. Those who return from their ten years of service are regarded as the core disciples and teachers.

A small team of leaders are elected to oversee Pike and its culture, as was intended by Jade's final instructions. Votes for leaders are cast by those who have spent at least five years in service to the cause.

# The Red Fang - Sienna's Black Ops Legacy

Sienna Khan, while in charge of the White Fang, used her connections to create a black ops team that she code named "the Red Fang." This organization was intended to be a covert surgical strike operations team that could perform essential operations without the direct intervention of the White Fang; particularly without the bureaucracy or public attention that it drew. Their mission: to track down and eliminate key figures that are directly or indirectly responsible for anti-Faunus rhethoric and exploitation.

The team was hand-picked by Sienna from among her loyal followers. Combat experience was important, but the most crucial factors were quick wit, sound decision making, loyalty, and dedication to the cause of the White Fang. Over the course of two years, Sienna increased the membership of the Red Fang to twenty four members.

At the fall of Beacon, when communications were severed, each of the operational teams lost contact with each other. Since there was no contingency plan that addressed this scenario, each team leader had to decide independently how to proceed until contact could be re-established with Sienna.

The Red Fang was only known to Sienna and its operatives. There are no official records to prove it exists, and even the top lieutenants of the White Fang are unaware of its presence. When Sienna was killed, knowledge of the Red Fang disappeared with her. Leadership of the faction would be therefore transferred by circumstance to the lead field operative, Casius Oak. However, knowledge of Sienna's death has yet to reach many of the teams acting independently.

The Red Fang is currently operating in six separate teams across Remnant, each lead by one of the top lieutenants.

## Top Lieutenants

### Casius Oak

Casius Oak is the official new leader of the Red Fang due to Sienna Khan's death. Casius maintained a communication channel with Sienna for intelligence gathering through the White Fang, but was unaware of Adam's coup until it happened.

Casius is driven by similar motivations as Adam Taurus, but maintains control with caution and calculation. He is clever, strategic, and many of the operatives of the Red Fang consider him to the spiritual successor to Sienna. Though Casius is not the best warrior in the Red Fang, he was entrusted as her right hand due to his excellent tactical awareness and sound decision making.

Casius maintains several high profile contacts in the White Fang, and uses them to obtain or pass intelligence through the appropriate channels. Though his contacts are unaware of his black ops assignments, they respect him as a notable member of the White Fang.

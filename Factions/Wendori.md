# Wendori

There are eight Wendori Tribes located on the coastline of the kingdom of Vale, southwest of the city of Vale, along the most traveled road. Their outposts are among the safest in the region and make travel safer for those who pay the tolls to pass through their territory. Their tribesmen fight off Grimm in the area and offer paid escort services between the larger cities for additional payment.

The Wendori are Warrior tribes with a culture that outsiders may feel deeply uncomfortable with, but their beliefs have made them extremely adept at fighting the Grimm. The phrase "The Wendori are always watching" is well known throughout central Sanus. It is partially in reference to the war paint they sometimes put on their eyes to appear open, and partially a reference to how uncomfortable citizens feel around them.

## Karmic & Worldly Beliefs

The driving belief in Wendori culture is that death is just a recycling process of souls. They believe that all souls reincarnate back within Remnant and that souls will return to their original family lines unless they get lost.

It is a cultural taboo to fear death, almost to the point of being a sin. Those who overtly fear death are considered to have been lost souls that weren't meant to reincarnate with the Wendori. Such individuals will be treated as outsiders, and will generally be forced to do menial work within the tribe unless they leave by their own volition. However, those who endured life as a second-class citizen in the Wendori tribe are welcomed to return again in the next life with their fears conquered.

### The Grimm Trials

On their thirteenth birthday, each Wendori is given one month to pass the Grimm Trials to prove themselves as a soul that was meant to reincarnate with the Wendori tribe. Failure means they were not suited for the tribe, and it typically ends in death. Success means they will receive their first bone totem and become young warriors of their tribe.

The Grimm Trials are dangerous and may be considered barbaric to outsiders, but their adherence to it has resulted in many generations of elite warriors. Wendori tend to remain very loyal to their tribes throughout their life, but those that seek out the Huntsmen academies for additional training tend to have a very high rate of acceptance.

Due to the dangers of de-population, the trials for "the sacred child-bearers" (women) are less likely to result in death. This is never viewed as demeaning within the Wendori; rather there is a slight Matriarchal lean to some of the Wendori's customs.

### Birth Rituals

Great importance is given to birth and death, as well as pregnancy. These events are considered sacred.

When a woman is pregnant, Wendori priests will perform rituals to help any previous Wendori souls find their way to the mother. While pregnant, women wield tremendous power within Wendori society. Any disrespect or disobedience of a resonable request to a pregnant woman is met with severe consequences, most notably a loss of social status and forced fasting. These behaviors also apply for pregnant women that are not part of the Wendori culture, although punishments might not be as severe.

### Burials and Death Rituals

Burial grounds and the process of burials are sacred. Funerals have a traditional ritual performed by a Bonesman to aid the soul's next journey through Necros. Wendori whose bodies cannot be recovered are deeply mourned for the loss of their connection to the tribe. Though fearing death is taboo, the fear of being lost from the tribe is a deep-seeded fear. This fear binds the tribes together and keeps them close to home. It is common for tribes to search out areas where Wendori are believed to have fallen, hoping to reunite them with proper burial rituals.

If a deceased individual was considered to be a valiant warrior, having earned at least three bone totems in their life, their dominant hand will be removed to recover its bones. The rest of the body will be buried, and the bones from their hand will be prepared as bone totems for the next generation.

Wendori bodies are placed directly into the ground without any casket, with their arm propped upward if their hand was removed for bone totems.

## Culture

### Attire, War Paint, and Bones

The Wendori are always outfitted for battle, even during formal events. Fashion is usually designed to emphasize one's physique, particularly upper body strength for men. Women are more likely to wear fashion accessories than men. War paint is a common cosmetic in daily life, and is often expected during sacred rituals and traditional events.

Bones are believed to be powerful spiritual tools that empower life, strengthen warriors, bring luck, ward off evil spirits, and bring honor to the afterlife. It is not uncommon for Wendori to use bones in their furnishings and decorations.

It is considered unnatural and vile to leave no bones on death (i.e. the Grimm). In times of war, if bones are collected from an enemy, it represents respect for that warrior's talent; even if that talent was used for evil.

### Food & Entertainment

Spicy foods are among the favorite meals in Wendori culture, and the meat of dangerous wildlife is also of great importance. The spicier a meal is, within reason, the better. They find a lot of foreign dishes to be too bland for their tastes. Alcohol and drugs are not commonly consumed, but some Wendori enjoy whiskeys or ales with a strong kick.

Wendori games and sports tend to be about combat, athleticism, and other feats of physical mastery. Theatrical performances typically involve elaborate fights, and usually there is a single pivot fight somewhere in the play. The pivot fight involves real combat between two sides, and the outcome of who is victorious determines how the story will end.

### Bone Totems

Bone Totems (simply "totems" in casual conversation) are small trinkets of bone that are made using the finger bones of deceased ancestors. The Wendori believe those ancestors will watch over those who possess their totems, which provides their sacred source of luck and protection. Totems are added to a necklace or used as accessories of one's outfit, but they are always visibly displayed due to their significance.

Bone totems undergo a simple blessing by the Bonesmen before being rewarded. Only Bonesmen and the tribal leader can bestow a bone totem. Totems are rewarded for performing valient deeds that relate to fighting Grimm, victory in combat tournaments, or for societal achievements such as being selected for an important role in the tribe. Mothers will receive a bone totem if one of their children receives three bone totems. As one acquires more bone totems, the expectations of your deeds are higher.

Power, authority, and respect in the culture is in part indicated by the number of one's bone totems. The Wendori are expected to generally obey those who possess more bone totems than they do, which creates a natural hierarchy of power and status. Four to six totems generally indicates a high status within the society. Outsiders can receive bone totems under the same rules as Wendori, but outsiders would rarely seek these bestowals for any reason.

### Lineage and Children

Lineage has little importance among the Wendori other than as a direct descendent of the sacred child-bearer (the mother). Mothers are considered to have all rights of lineage and name, inasmuch as it exists. The entire clan is expected to assist with the raising of their young. New mothers are expected to be part of this communal raising until all of their children have reached the age of fifteen and passed the Grimm Trials.

Marriage is not a common practice and has no official ceremony or binding, though some Wendori do decide to get unofficially married.

Wendori men and women typically offer their intentions to mate by suggesting that they "get spicy" together. Even if foreigners have never heard the phrase, they'll probably understand the body language and tone. There are very few social norms about this process. Wendori are very open and non-chalant about their sexuality because there are no social taboos surrounding it.

## Outposts

Wendori outposts are built as a joint effort with all the Wendori tribes to keep their territory safe and profitable. They use natural boundaries for defense where possible and build reinforced walls, battlements, and gates to defend their cities. Every outpost has at least one watchtower overlooking the landscape.

There are many secondary walls built throughout Wendori territory to fence off access and funnel Grimm movements into natural bottlenecks and tactical combat points. All Wendori tribes collaborate with these access points and tactics, allowing them to distribute the load of Grimm between each tribe.

During the day, a team of warriors will immediately be sent to deal with any Grimm threat that is discovered from a watchtower. Merchants or travellers passing through will be kept aware of any known threats.

Every Wendori tribe has vowed to maintain a sacred alliance of retaliation during war. If any raiding party ever attacks one of their outposts, every tribe will participate in hunting down and killing every last member of the tribe that initiated the raiding party. This a well-established fact known throughout the area, which has nearly eliminated the concern for raids throughout their tribes.

## Roles in Society

Every member of the Wendori tribe is considered a soldier after reaching the appropriate age, and they will regularly participate in the defense of the tribes. However, a Wendori is only considered a warrior if their primary role is combat and scouting.

Like any other functioning economy, Wendori fill jobs as craftsmen, builders, hunters, farmers, and other essential roles. Most jobs involve the production of a good or service. A modest portion of their supplies come from traders, and a large portion of their income is from travelers paying the tolls to pass through their territory. There are no bureaucracies, and no desk or paper work. Tribal leaders are the closet thing they have to diplomats.

The Bonesmen are the high shamans. They perform sacred rituals, rites of passage, help souls on their journey through Necros, host traditional events, coordinate the Grimm trials, decide upon the recipients of the bone totems, and act as the priests of Wendori society.

## Combat

Wendori typically fight in small teams, though large enough to safely take on whatever threat they're facing. They have a habit of showing off, but only if they're confident they can do it without risk of harm. A misstep that gets anyone hurt will lose them face and be a source of embarassment or shame, especially if someone else had to fix their mistake.

The combat style is extremely aggressive, with an emphasis on weakening any serious threat as quickly as possible. It is much more important to cripple or disable two enemies than it is to kill one.

Most fighting takes place in bottlenecks and strategic combat points the Wendori have established through their territory. If combat has to take place in the open, the Wendori like to surround and flank enemies whenever possible. They have common coordination patterns that they use.

During tournaments, the Wendori give the most credit for winning their battles as fast as possible. Wendori will therefore never stand around and size up their opponent, nor give their enemy any time to either. All tactical decisions are made in rapid succession based on the circumstance.

### Weapons

Most Wendori are trained in a ranged weapon, particularly one that is well-suited for city defenses, and a melee weapon. Wendori tend to pride themselves on their skill with melee weapons, while their ranged weapons are regarded more as practical tools for survival.

Despite having access to modern armanents, most ranged weapons are either heavy thrown weapons that make use of physical strength, or compound bows that can easily pierce thick armors. Such weapons are also more preferable for hunters due to their silence.

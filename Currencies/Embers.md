## Embers

Embers are beautiful coins that look like the embodiment of fire essence forged with the forces of creation. They feel warm to the touch and have the texture of moving liquid despite being solid. They are semi-transparent with a shimmering layer of swirling fire. The exact color and denomination markings correspond to the type of Ember.

When an Ember is spent by willful intention, it suddenly dissipates into flames and activates its power after releasing a wave of heat. The power weaves a new conjuration into existence based on its nature and the user’s intention. The creative forces within the Ember will always integrate safely within the world.

The conjured results will take a long scene to fully emerge, and will slowly modify each part of the affected scene over this time frame. It will never harm or significantly disrupt anyone present, but minor disruptions are expected of anyone in the area. The scene may experience a wide range of emerging materials, reforming and slow moving ground, etc.

When an Ember is held, the holder can intuitively understand what it can do, how it functions, and what the results will be with a given intention.

### Construction Embers

Construction Embers will permanently create or modify buildings and other structures: palaces, fortifications, watch towers, walls, stone statues, temples, etc. A sufficiently powerful variant could build an entire village. Lesser variants may be used to add additional rooms to a building, build a door or gate into a wall, etc.

Construction Embers are intended to add or modify constructions in meaningful ways. Any alterations that appear to be solely for destructive or diminishing purposes will likely not come to fruition.

A Construction Ember’s power is approximated by equivalent time investment by professional workers. Construction Embers can optionally allot up to 10% of its capacity for a proportional percent of a Terrain Ember of the same tier. Another 10% can apply in the same way for Supply Embers. This allows the Ember to influence the structure’s landscaping or furnish rooms as needed if those aspects are desired.

### Sacred Ember

Sacred Embers will align an area’s energies to become more “sacred.” These areas more holy, positive, and light-aligned. Sacred areas attract good spirits, peaceful wildlife and inhabitants, encourage improved moods, tends to reduce conflict and repel darker influences, etc. The area won’t actually improve anyone’s luck, but it will often feel as though it does.

Most areas are not influenced by light or darkness. A Sacred Ember used on an area with a dark presence or dark energies will shift the area closer to the light, but may not shift the influence out of darkness.

The amount of light or dark energy in an area is measured in PPM (parts per million), with a saturation limit of around 100 PPM for either dark or holy energies. 0 PPM represents an area with no light or dark influence. Light and dark energies generally do not coexist well and will purge equal proportions of each other upon interaction relatively quickly.

The contents of a Sacred Ember are represented by 100 PPM solutions for a given area of influence.

------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:
 Sacred I   | 10m diameter of influence; a large room, a gathering spot, a family garden, etc. | 1        
 Sacred II  | 100m diameter of influence; a large estate property, a city block, etc.          | 2        
 Sacred III | 1km diameter of influence; a small village, a local woods, etc.                  | 3        
 Sacred IV  | 5km diameter of influence; a city, a small forest, etc.                          | 4        
 Sacred V   | 25km diameter of influence; a sprawling city, a large forest, etc.               | 5        
 Sacred VI  | 100km diameter of influence; a local region, etc.                                | 6        

### Supply Ember

Supply Embers will conjure a supply of materials, items, furniture, decorations, and other supplies within a given area. Powerful variants can supply an army with equipment or outfit a castle with royal furniture, decorations, and fortified defenses. Lesser variants can re-design a room, install a trap, or fill an empty gallery with statues and artwork.

A Supply Ember’s power is approximated by equivalent time investment to create the supplies from common and affordable materials by professional artisans and specialists. Superior materials can be used, but this cuts the listed crafting hours by half. Luxury materials can be used, but this cuts the listed hours by five.

------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------:
 Supply I   | 1000 craft hours: supply a set of furniture, outfit a soldier with excellent equipment, etc. | 1        
 Supply II  | 10,000 craft hours (1 year, 5 workers): fill a gallery with beautiful art and statues, etc.  | 2        
 Supply III | 100,000 craft hours (2 years, 25 workers): a full estate with luxury furnishings, etc.       | 3        
 Supply IV  | 1 million craft hours (10 years, 50 workers): a giant palace with luxury furnishings, etc.   | 4        
 Supply V   | 5 million craft hours (25 years, 100 workers): furnish and decorate an entire city, etc.     | 5        

### Terrain Ember

Terrain Embers will permanently create or modify an environment’s terrain, landscaping, vegetation, farmland, etc. A sufficiently powerful variant could excavate a large quarry, create a jungle, or place a large lake in the middle of a desert. Lesser variants may be used to plant gardens, dig tunnels and foundations, or create trails through a jungle.

A Terrain Ember’s power is approximated by equivalent time investment by professional landscapers. For vegetation that is difficult to move, such as trees, they are treated as young and easy to plant. The final result, however, will be the mature forms of any vegetation planted unless the user specifically requests otherwise.

-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------:
 Terrain I   | 100 work hours: cut a trail through a jungle, dig a large hole, plant a small garden, etc. | 1        
 Terrain II  | 5000 work hours (6 months, 5 workers): prepare farmland and crops, dig a long tunnel, etc. | 2        
 Terrain III | 100,000 work hours (2 years, 25 workers): excavate a quarry or mine, etc.                  | 3        
 Terrain IV  | 1 million work hours (10 years, 50 workers): build a long canal, etc.                      | 4        
 Terrain V   | 5 million work hours (25 years, 100 workers): plant an entire jungle, etc.                 | 5

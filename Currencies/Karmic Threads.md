## Karmic Threads

Karmic Threads are a physical manifestation of blessings provided by deities and gods. It grants a single favor, blessing, or manifesting of destiny to the user that it was bestowed to. Karmic Threads cannot be stolen or used by anyone other than their intended recipient, nor can it be unwillingly separated from them as it will just reappear by the owner.

Karmic Threads appear as thick, unbreakable threads made of raw essence. To activate its blessing, the user holds the thread and makes their intention known. The holder always understands intuitively how the Karmic Thread works, and can adjust their intention accordingly. Upon use, the thread dissipates and begins weaving its energies into the universe.

It can take days, weeks, or even months for a Karmic Thread to take effect. In order to function correctly there will be many discrete butterfly effects initiated through the world to coordinate the appropriate changes without affecting free will. The result will typically be in the form of an opportunity, although some may just take effect without notice; such as instances of survival. The user can intuitively sense when the effects have triggered and act on them accordingly.

Higher tiers of Karmic Thread will offer greater opportunities and improved metrics that apply to the opportunity, but are otherwise identical to their lower tiers.

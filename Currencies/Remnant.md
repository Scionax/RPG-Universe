## Remnants

Remnant is a well-polished, reflective silvery metallic coin. It feels like liquid to the touch, and will very gently warp and distort like water when disturbed.

Each Remnant coin holds a very specific memory or experience within it. When the user holds the coin and intends to spend it, they will experience a set of memories as though they are living through the experience themselves. For the duration of the memory they will forget about their outside life; they will be so encased in the simulation that they will experience every thought as it had originally been experienced.

When the simulation ends, the user will recover from the event and be able to recall all of the events with exceptional precision. That memory is now a part of them.

Remnant coins always hold significant meaning or purpose. They are not random, and acquiring the information they hold should be meaningful. They hold secrets of the past, clues to important events or locations, may lead someone down a new path, acquire useful knowledge or insight, identify new adventures or quests, etc. Each Remnant coin is different, but they are all significant in their own way.

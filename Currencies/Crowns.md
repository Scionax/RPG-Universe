## Crowns

Crowns are golden coins with ribbed edges that can be spent to purchase protective blessings from spirits and gods. Protective blessings will trigger automatically in the moment when they are needed, and are designed to protect the user from a specific form of harm or to help recover.

Higher tiered Crowns are more powerful and effective, but are otherwise identical to their lesser variants. Some effects may last for a given duration, but each blessing will only activate once. Once a blessing activates, the transaction is considered fulfilled.

By default, blessings purchased with Crowns will not activate if their benefit would be trivial, or if the user is facing a challenge they believe to be trivial. Users can designate the level of danger they should experience before their blessings will activate, which prevents wasting Crowns on training or conflicts that donâ€™t pose a serious threat.

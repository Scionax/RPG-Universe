## Ambrosia

Ambrosia are transparent, glass-like coins that look like wafts of colored energy being loosely held together in a coin shape. They represent the “open-ended” currency of the divine realm. It can be used as currency for any transaction, good, or service that could be made with divinity.

Ambrosia can be merged directly with the user’s aura by intent, or returned back to coin form at will. Those who can see auras will see its presence. It appears like a barely visible swath of energy that moves through the aura and seamlessly fades in and out. The user can also convert Ambrosia from their aura back to its coin form by willing it.

Since Ambrosia can recreate any other magical currency, it follows a general exchange rate as follows:

 **Ambrosia** | **Tier** 
:------------:|:--------:
 1            | 2        
 4            | 3        
 15           | 4        
 60           | 5        
 250          | 6        
 1000         | 7

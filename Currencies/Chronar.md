## Chronar

Chronar are shiny platinum coins that gently vibrate without the loss of energy.

Chronar allow the user to slow their perception of time. To use this power, the user holds the coin and flicks it into the air with the intention of spending it. The moment the coin is airborne the user’s perception of time is altered, allowing them to perceive and react significantly faster than anyone else.

The effect can last anywhere from a few seconds to a minute depending on the coin’s capacity. Flicking the coin or disrupting its path has no influence on the power’s duration. However, the coin attempts to move through its expected trajectory in such a way that its timing expires the moment it lands. The coin moves at an unnaturally fast or slow rate to accommodate this effect, but it can’t account for any unforeseen disruptions.

## Spark

Spark is a coin made out of polished quartz with veins of electric energy crackling inside it. It has a perpetual vibration that is barely noticeable, and generates a minuscule amount of current without diminishing its supply.

Spark shares similarities with Karmic Threads and Sol. It manifests social events through well-placed butterfly effects, assisted coordination of projects, slight motivation and mood magic that encourages general interest and assistance, etc. If the event cannot be conjured with subtle magic influence alone, Spark will summon representatives to act as professional organizers. The representatives will begin the process, help oversee the project, and keep timelines on track.

The creation of events cannot directly affect free will; it can only make suggestions. Spark will never force anyone to come to an event, nor will it manifest an event like someone’s funeral (thus forcing someone to die) or a peace treaty between warring nations (forcing them to a decision they didn’t agree to). However, if those events are destined to happen due to circumstances that have already occurred, Spark can be used to affect how those events play out or how well-organized the event is.

To activate Spark, the user holds the coin in their hand and imagines an event that they would like to have coordinated. The events are typically social in nature (parties, parades, local festivals, etc), since they are the easiest to coordinate without affecting free will, but can include practical matters or business events if free will is not affected in coordinating them.

Users can also imagine their preferred role in the event such as a casual participant, the master of ceremony, etc. The power will attempt to accommodate these desires if the user’s role makes sense for the situation. If the Spark is more powerful than the nature of the event created, the user has much more refined control over the event.

## Map

Enchanted maps can be instructed to draw (or continue drawing) any area within 1 kilometer from the user's location. The maps will automatically draw themselves as though done by a master cartographer at 25 times their normal speed. If there are already public maps available for reference, this speed is multiplied by four.

By default, enchanted maps are drawn at a national scale; they can only be smaller if an appropriate upgrade is acquired. Map precision is approximated, rather than overly specific, for the sake of draw speed; true precision takes much longer due to measurement requirements. The map can be cleared (fully erased) at the owner's discretion. Features hidden from the public will not be revealed. Owner can toggle on/off any of the upgrades to avoid clutter or get precise information.

## Weapon Band

Weapons bands are enchanted bands that clip to a sword, dagger, axe, war hammer, polearm, or other melee weapon. They will adjust their size to the hilt and blend in once attached, essentially merging as one with the weapon. Removing the band takes a long scene, and only the enchantment’s owner can remove it. While merged with a weapon it will empower that weapon with any supplemental upgrades it possesses.
